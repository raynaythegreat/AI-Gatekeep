# GateKeep (AI-Gatekeep)

GateKeep is an open-source AI assistant focused on **web development** workflows: planning, implementing changes, and helping you apply commits to GitHub repositories.

## Core principles
- **Bring your own keys (BYOK):** users provide their own API keys for providers like OpenAI/Anthropic/Groq/OpenRouter.
- **Safety-first:** never paste API keys into GitHub issues, screenshots, or chat transcripts.
- **Production-ready output:** when modifying repositories, GateKeep produces complete file outputs (no placeholders).
